## [Unreleased]

Initial release. EpiBranch brings the branching-process cores of the R packages
simulist, epichains and ringbp together in one Julia package with a shared
simulation engine. It provides:

- Branching-process and contact-network simulation through one engine
  (`BranchingProcess`, `NetworkProcess`). Offspring, generation time and
  clinical progression are set on the model.
- Interventions as population-level policies — isolation, contact tracing, and
  ring or mass vaccination — attached to a model and resolved through competing
  risks.
- Per-case attributes (age, type, susceptibility, clinical presentation) and an
  observation layer for under-reporting.
- Line-list and contact-tracing output as DataFrames (`linelist`, `contacts`)
  and transmission-chain statistics (`chain_statistics`).
- Analytical results where closed forms exist: extinction and epidemic
  probability, chain-size and chain-length laws, offspring-distribution helpers,
  end-of-outbreak probability, and superspreading summaries.
- A distribution interface for inference: `chain_size_distribution`,
  `chain_length_distribution` and `offspring_distribution` return `Distribution`s
  that sit directly on the right-hand side of a Turing `~`.
- Containment probability and scenario sweeps for comparing interventions.
