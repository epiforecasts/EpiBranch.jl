# ── ModelSpec ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A model specification: a transmission process together with the modelling
# layers that force and observe it. The process is the reusable kernel — the
# pathogen you fit and hold fixed while varying policy — and the spec adds the
# within-host progression, the interventions, the per-individual attributes,
# and the observation model. The observed data is not held here; it is a
# `loglikelihood` argument. See the design notes in `docs/src/design.md`.
#
# A `ModelSpec` is not itself a process. `simulate`/`loglikelihood` unwrap it:
# the process is the dispatched model, and the spec's layers are passed in as
# the forcing inputs the engine already threads. So there are no per-method
# forwards — only the entry points know about the spec.

# Warn when every terminal transition in `progression` is independently gated
# below certainty: with none that always occurs, a case can clear every gate
# and reach no terminal state at all — `:outcome` stays unset and, on a
# structure-driven model, the infectious window this case opened never closes
# (a different symptom of the same gap that `_warn_uncovered_terminal_states`,
# in branching_process.jl, catches for states missing from `until`). Skipped
# when any terminal's `terminal_certainty` is `missing`: unknowable without an
# individual (or a transition type that hasn't declared it), so silence over a
# possible false warning.

"""
    ModelSpec(process; progression, interventions, attributes, observation, recorder)

Combine a transmission model (who infects whom, and when) with the rest of
an outbreak scenario. Pass the result to [`simulate`](@ref), or to
`loglikelihood(data, model)` to compare it with observed data (the data are
not stored in the model).

- `progression`: the natural history of a case, as a vector of
  [`Transition`](@ref)s and other steps such as [`Recovery`](@ref) and
  [`Death`](@ref): latent period, symptom onset, hospitalisation, outcome.
- `interventions`: control measures, such as [`Isolation`](@ref),
  [`ContactTracing`](@ref) and [`RingVaccination`](@ref).
- `attributes`: population characteristics drawn for each person, such as
  [`clinical_presentation`](@ref) (incubation period, asymptomatic fraction)
  and [`demographics`](@ref) (age, sex). Give one, or several in a vector.
- `observation`: how cases are reported, such as
  [`PerCaseObservation`](@ref) (detection probability and reporting delay).
- `recorder`: rarely needed; see [`ContactRecorder`](@ref).

Every keyword left out keeps the value the transmission model already has,
so `ModelSpec(process)` behaves exactly like `process`.

    BranchingProcess(NegBin(2.5, 0.16), Gamma(2.5, 2.0));

)
