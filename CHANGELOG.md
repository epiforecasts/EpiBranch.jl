# Changelog

All notable changes to EpiBranch.jl are recorded here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `NetworkProcess` (in `EpiNetwork`) is now a continuous-time contact-rate
  model. Transmission along each edge is a contact hazard racing the
  infector's recovery or isolation, drawn from a contact-interval kernel,
  replacing the earlier coin-flip-per-edge version. Shortening a case's
  infectious window — through recovery or isolation — now genuinely curtails
  onward spread.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-16

Initial release. EpiBranch brings together the branching-process cores of
[simulist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/simulist),
[epichains](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epichains) and
[ringbp](https://github.com/epiforecasts/ringbp), the analytical superspreading
methods of [superspreading](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/superspreading), and
the post-exposure prophylaxis model of [pepbp](https://github.com/sophiemeakin/pepbp),
in one Julia package with a shared simulation engine. It provides:

- One simulation engine across a branching-process core (`BranchingProcess`)
  and structure-driven companion packages: contact networks (`NetworkProcess`,
  in `EpiNetwork`) and continuous-time household transmission (`HouseholdProcess`,
  in `EpiHouseholds`). Offspring, generation time and clinical progression are
  set on the model.
- Interventions as population-level policies — isolation, contact tracing, and
  ring or mass vaccination — attached to a model and resolved through competing
  risks.
- Per-case attributes (age, type, susceptibility, clinical presentation) and an
  observation layer for under-reporting.
- Line-list and contact-tracing output as DataFrames (`linelist`, `contacts`)
  and transmission-chain statistics (`chain_statistics`).
- Analytical results where closed forms exist: extinction and epidemic
  probability, chain-size and chain-length laws, offspring-distribution helpers,
  end-of-outbreak probability, and superspreading summaries.
- A distribution interface for inference: `chain_size_distribution`,
  `chain_length_distribution` and `offspring_distribution` return `Distribution`s
  that sit directly on the right-hand side of a Turing `~`.
- A pairwise contact-interval likelihood for household data
  (`pairwise_surv_loglik`, `loglikelihood`), whose continuous-time Sellke
  simulator is its exact generative model.
- Containment probability and scenario sweeps for comparing interventions.
