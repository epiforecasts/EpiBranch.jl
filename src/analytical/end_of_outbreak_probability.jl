# ── End-of-outbreak probability ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# π(τ; R, k, generation_time) is the probability that no further cases
# occur in a cluster, given `τ` time has elapsed since the most recent
# observed case. Used as a principled per-cluster `is_finished` weight
# in the real-time chain-size mixture likelihood (see
# `loglikelihood(::ChainSizes, ::Distribution)`).
#
# Closed form for full reporting (`ρ = 1`):
#
#   π(τ; R, k, G) = ((k + R · (1 − S(τ))) / (k + R))^k
#
# with `S(τ) = ccdf(generation_time, τ)`. Reduces to the offspring
# zero-probability `G(0) = (k/(k+R))^k` at `τ = 0` and tends to 1 as
# `τ → ∞`. Reference: Thompson, Morgan & Jansen, *Phil Trans B* 2019,
# in the per-case Markov-property reduction at the most recent
# observed case.
#
# Under-reporting (`ρ < 1`) needs the full Volterra recursion for the
# per-case η(τ) and is not implemented here.

full reporting. Returns a value in `[0, 1]`.
